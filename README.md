This is a snapshot taken of Christophe David's implementation of
Jean Meeus's _Astronomical Algorithms_. I originally downloaded this in
2011, and the files in the zip file all contained timestamps from 2001.

The original seems to have dropped off the internet, so I've uploaded it
to preserve it. If anybody knows of an "official" location for this code,
please let me know.

See `AstronomicalAlgorithms.h` for the license.

This code does *not* include anything related to the planets.
